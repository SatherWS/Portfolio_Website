SUPPORT:
    
Since PUREMEDIA is distributed for free, support is not offered. PUREMEDIA is coded according 
to current web standards and we did our best to make the template easy to use and modify.
If you have minimum web development experience, you can easily modify the template. 
However, If you're still new to HTML and CSS, I suggest that you visit the

jQuery in your skill-set, you can also check out these tutorials:
